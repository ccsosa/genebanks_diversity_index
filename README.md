# Description:

This code performs the following steps:
- Preprocessing (0_preprocessing.R)
- Collection composition and taxonomy (1_Taxonomic_index_Country.R)
- (ii) Ecogeography (2_Ecogeographic_index.R)
- (iii) Documentation completeness (3_completeness_index.R)

_______

# Recommendations:
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please follow the next recommendations and instructions: 
- (0_preprocessing.R ) and Ecogeography (2_Ecogeographic_index.R) are the slowiest steps in this pipeline. Be patient
- Please provide the germplasm collection data in MCDP format. see (https://www.genesys-pgr.org/documentation/basics#mcpd)
- The Geographical quality score, and taxonomic geographical score can be obtained from https://github.com/alliance-datascience/genebank-general/tree/dev
- Only use accessions with high and medium geographical quality score to run the Ecogeography (2_Ecogeographic_index.R) step
- If genetic data is not available please use the step Genetics diversity and genetic usability information availability (4_Genetic_sequenced_coverage.R)

> [!CAUTION]
> The ECADI must be interpreted using the four components together!
- This code was designed to calculate Hill-Simpson (Effective Number of Species), and Margalef.
- The main output for the ECADI was calculated using Hill-Simpson!
